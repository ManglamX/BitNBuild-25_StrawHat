## 📌 Project Abstract

Our project focuses on solving the inefficiencies and logistical challenges faced by local tiffin service providers due to manual operations and lack of modern technology by developing NourishNet, a SaaS-based platform integrating a vendor operations dashboard and a consumer mobile application.
The solution aims to streamline vendor management, optimize delivery routes using AI, enable real-time delivery tracking, and provide flexible subscription and billing management, ensuring better operational efficiency for providers, convenience and transparency for customers, and sustainable growth for the tiffin service industry.
